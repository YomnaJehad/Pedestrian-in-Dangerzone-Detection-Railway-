# Pedestrian-in-Dangerzone-Detection-Railway-
## Introduction

In recent advances of neural networks and computer vision especially in object detection, We can now detect multiple or single objects in real-time videos with very high precision
in mannered time. Object detection is an important task that detects some behavior and extracts useful information from images. Pedestrian detection in dangerous areas like railway tracks is a very critical task to solve

## What is this project

This project is a Computer Vision project to detect pedestrians in fixed danger zones like railway roads using Detectron2
